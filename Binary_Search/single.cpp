üîç Problem:
In a sorted array, every element appears exactly twice, except one single element.
Find that element in O(log n) time.

üß† Key Idea:
Since the array is sorted and all pairs are together, we can use binary search with index patterns to find the single element.

‚ú® Step-by-step Intuition:
Start with:

l = 0, r = n - 1.

Binary search loop while l <= r:

Find middle: m = (l + r) / 2.

What to look for:

Each pair starts at an even index and ends at the next (odd index), before the single element.

After the single element, this pattern breaks: pairs start at odd indices.

So:

If m is even:

If nums[m] == nums[m + 1] üëâ single is on the right, so l = m + 2.

If nums[m] != nums[m + 1] üëâ single is on the left or at m, so r = m.

If m is odd:

If nums[m] == nums[m - 1] üëâ single is on the right, so l = m + 1.

If nums[m] != nums[m - 1] üëâ single is on the left, so r = m - 1.

Break condition: If nums[m] is not equal to either neighbor, it‚Äôs the unique one.

At the end, return nums[m] (or even nums[l]).

üí° One-liner Trick:
‚ÄúUse index pairing logic: before the single element, pairs start at even indices; after it, they start at odd ones.‚Äù

üîç Problem:
In a sorted array, every element appears exactly twice, except for one single element. Find that one in O(log n) time.

üß† Key Idea:
Use binary search and leverage the fact that:

Before the single element ‚Üí all pairs are correctly aligned (even index matched with next odd).

After the single element ‚Üí the pattern breaks.

‚ú® Step-by-step Intuition:
Start with l = 0, r = n - 1.

In each iteration:

Compute m = (l + r)/2.

If m is odd, decrement it to make it even, so you‚Äôre always checking the first element of a pair.

Now check:

If nums[m] == nums[m + 1]:
üëâ The pair is valid.
üîÅ So the single element must be after this pair ‚Üí l = m + 2.

If nums[m] != nums[m + 1]:
üëâ The pair is broken.
üîÅ So the single element is at m or before ‚Üí r = m.

Loop ends when l == r ‚Üí that's the position of the single element.

üí° One-liner Trick:
‚ÄúAlign to even index, check its pair. If pair is fine ‚Üí go right. If broken ‚Üí go left.‚Äù
