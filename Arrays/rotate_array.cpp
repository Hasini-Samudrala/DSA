in short - we need to roatte the array by some places to the left and return the array

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> result(n);
        k %= n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[(i + k) % n] = nums[i];

        nums = result;
    }

/*
INTUTION :
first if the size of the array is 5 and we were supposed to rotate by say 6 places this would lead to the originalarray with one place 
moved so we wpuld do that modulus thing k = k%n so that number of places can be reduced in some situtaions 
next we would move a particular element to the (i+k)%n position 
Because if you're rotating right by k, the element at index i moves to (i + k) â€” but to stay in bounds, we take modulo n.
